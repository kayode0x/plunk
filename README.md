<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features
The Plunk Go SDK includes the following features:

Transactional Emails: Use the SendTransactionalEmail method to send one or more emails to your subscribers.

Contacts: Create, update, and delete contacts. You can also get a list of contacts, as well as the number of contacts in your account.

Easy integration: The Plunk Go SDK is easy to integrate into your Go applications, with a simple and intuitive API.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

To get started with the Plunk Go SDK, simply install it using the go get command:

``` go get github.com/kayode0x/plunk ```

Then, create a new Plunk object with your Plunk API key and start using the SDK to send and track emails.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the Plunk Go SDK to send a simple email:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/kayode0x/plunk"
)

func main() {
	// create a new Plunk object with your API key
	p, _ := plunk.New("YOUR_API_KEY", nil)

    // optionally, you can set some configuration options.
    config := &plunk.Config{
        BaseUrl: "https://api.useplunk.com",
        Debug: true,
        Client: &http.Client{
            Timeout: 10 * time.Second,
        },
    }

    // create a new Plunk object with your API key and config
    p, err := plunk.New("YOUR_API_KEY", config)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error creating Plunk object: %v", err)
        return
    }

	// create a new email payload
	payload := TransactionalEmailPayload{
		To:      "test@example.com",
		Subject: "Test Subject",
		Body:    "Test Body",
	}

	// send the email
	response, err := plunk.SendTransactionalEmail(payload)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error sending email: %v", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Email sent: %v", response)
}

```

To run tests, you need a Plunk API key. You can get one by signing up for a free account at https://useplunk.com.

Add the environment variable PLUNK_SECRET_KEY in your .env file with your Plunk API key.

Then, run the tests using the following command:

``` go test -v ```

If you receive an error that says contact already exists, you can manually delete the contact from your Plunk account, and then run the tests again.
